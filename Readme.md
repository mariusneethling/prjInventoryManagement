Pointer types: 
Pointer types in C# allow variables to hold memory addresses of another type (Bit by Bit Dev, 2024). They’re used mainly for coding in .NET or with unmanaged code (Bit by Bit Dev, 2024). Direct memory manipulation can break type safety and therefore pointer code must be placed inside an unsafe context and the project must be compiled with the Allow unsafe code option (Bit by Bit Dev, 2024). Typical keywords will include things like unsafe, fixed, and the dereference/address operators * and & (Bit by Bit Dev, 2024).
